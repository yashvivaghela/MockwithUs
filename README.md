# MockwithUs

This website includes a mock interview with some questions chosen at random from the whole dataset. The questions will be presented, and a window will emerge in which the user can record their response. That recorded video will then be processed, and feedback regarding speaking style, expressions and the words which are not supposed to be used in a interview will be generated. Additionally, there is a feature that enables users to submit their CV's and the job descriptions they are applying for and get the similarity score between them.
